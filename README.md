# read-sizer
Nextflow module/workflow to convert paired-end sequencing read files to SIZ chunks

## Rationale
This module optimizes paired-end sequencing read files for parallel processing by splitting them into smaller, interleaved, and Zstandard-compressed (.fastq.zst) chunks. This approach enhances parallelism, reduces the need to stream file pairs, and achieves significant size savings.
